**Hello, Thanks for checking out my Minecraft Server Status script(s)!**  
Hopefully you can get some data from a minecraft server and use it some way that is useful.  

**Dependencies/Requirements:**  
 - Selenium (web scraper)
 - Python 3.x
 - Chrome or Firefox WebDriver (dependency of Selenium)

**known bug(s) for the scraper:** different browsers render the HTML elements differently and can become incompatible, but Chrome 83 (latest version at the time of writing) works.
