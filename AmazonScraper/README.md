**Hello, Thanks for checking out my Amazon Scraper!**  
The goal is to enter a product to search for (or perhaps multiple in parallel...) and a list of products 
that match the search with corresponding prices are available through methods within the Scraper's main class.  

**known bug(s):** prices in AmazonScraper.getPrices() don't yet line up with AmazonScraper.getProducts()  

**feature list:**  
- find the best deal (sale price vs. original)  
- find the lowest-priced item
